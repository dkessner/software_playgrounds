# Software Playgrounds

<br/>

What is a software playground?

- safe sandbox for exploration

- a familiar place where a student's prior knowledge is useful

<br/>
<br/>

Goal of this presentation:

- to give an overview of the landscape of educational / creative coding  

- to help you generate some ideas for your own software playground

---

# Python

<br/>

Python is a great for math lessons at all levels!

<br/>

Pre-algebra/algebra

- order of operations
- variables and formulas
- functions

<br/>

Precalculus

- sequences and series
- parametric equations (turtle graphics)

<br/>

# Processing

[Processing](https://processing.org) is one big playground,
suitable for students as early as middle school.

Drawing & animating with code:

- coordinate system
- RGB colors
- variables
- conditions
- functions
- loops

Intermediate:

- classes & objects
- array, ArrayList
- user interaction
- collision detection

---

# Processing advanced projects

<br/>

- 3D graphics
    - textures
    - 3D model import

- video

- image filtering

- audio input and visualization

- Kinect sensor
