# Goals

Goals of software playgrounds:

- safe sandbox for exploration
- leverage students prior knowledge for more meaningful first
coding experiences

Goal of this talk:

- to give an overview of some options for educational / creative coding
- to help you generate some ideas for bringing coding experiences into
  the classroom

---

# Python

Great for math lessons:
- Pre-algebra/algebra: 
    - order of operations
    - variables and formulas
    - functions
- Precalculus: 
    - sequences and series
    - parametric equations (turtle graphics)

# Processing

Processing is one big playground (quick demo?)

Middle school: drawing & animating with code:
- coordinate system
- RGB colors


---

# Processing advanced projects

- 3D graphics
    - textures
    - 3D model import
- video
- image filtering
- audio input and visualization
- Kinect sensor

video?
