# Software Playgrounds

<br/>

What is a software playground?

- safe sandbox for exploration

- a familiar place where a student's prior knowledge is useful

<br/>
<br/>

Goal of this presentation:

- to give an overview of the landscape of educational / creative coding  

- to help you generate some ideas for your own software playground

# Python

<br/>

Python is a great for math lessons at all levels!

<br/>

Pre-algebra/algebra

- order of operations
- variables and formulas
- functions

<br/>

Precalculus

- sequences and series
- parametric equations (turtle graphics)

<br/>

# Processing

Processing is one big playground (quick demo?)

Middle school: drawing & animating with code:
- coordinate system
- RGB colors


---

# Processing advanced projects

- 3D graphics
    - textures
    - 3D model import
- video
- image filtering
- audio input and visualization
- Kinect sensor

video?
